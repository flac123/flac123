flac123 implements mpg123's 'Remote Control' interface via option -R.
This is useful if you're writing a frontend to flac123 which needs a 
consistent, reliable interface to control playback.

There are several differences between the README.remote specifications
of mpg123, mpg321, and flac123:

a. mpg123 specifies @P as the output of the PAUSE command, whereas mpg321
specifies @S but uses @P.  flac123 uses @P.

b. mpg123 and mpg321 use <frames> as the argument to JUMP.  flac123 uses
seconds as the argument to JUMP.

c. mpg321 does not specify two output modes for @I.  flac123 uses two
output modes for @I.

d. mpg123 and mpg321 output @S for MPEG3 stream information.  flac123
does not output @S.


COMMANDS: (All commands can be shortened to first character only)
--------

LOAD <file>

Loads and starts playing <file>.

JUMP [+-]<seconds>
If '+' or '-' is specified, jumps <seconds> seconds forward, or backwards,
respectively, in the the flac file.  If neither is specifies, jumps to
absolute second <second> in the flac file.

PAUSE
Pauses the playback of the flac file; if already paused, restarts playback.

QUIT
Quits flac123.



OUTPUT:
------

@R FLAC123
flac123 tagline. Output at startup.

@I ID3:<a><b><c><d><e><f>
Prints out the metadata information after loading the flac file.
a = title (30 chars)
b = artist (30 chars)
c = album (30 chars)
d = year (4 chars)
e = comment (30 chars)
f = genre (30 chars)

@I filename
Prints out the filename of the flac file, minus the extension. Happens after
a flac file has been loaded and there is no metadata available.

@F <current-frame> <frames-remaining> <current-time> <time-remaining>
Frame decoding status updates (once per frame).
Current-frame and frames-remaining are integers; current-time and
time-remaining floating point numbers with two decimal places.

@P {0, 1, 2}
Stop/pause status.
0 - playing has stopped. When 'STOP' is entered, or the flac file is finished.
1 - Playing is paused. Enter 'PAUSE' or 'P' to continue.
2 - Playing has begun again.
